#notes:

* I've used html5 boilerplate as a bootstrap. All CSS is entirely handcoded (with a bit more time I'd have used someting more sensible, like a SASS preprocessor)

* I linked images off the internet rather than cut up the .png file, hope that's ok

* I haven't put any icons in due to time constraints. I'd use something like font-awesome for that, or generate an icon-set font from .svg images

* I've assumed that the top-right tile is a hover view.

* Breakpoints and their values are somewhat rudimentary: I wanted to illustrate the principle rather than provide a comprehensive solution. Ideally the setup would be finegrained so that the aspect ratio of the various sections would be more or less constant across various screen sizes.
